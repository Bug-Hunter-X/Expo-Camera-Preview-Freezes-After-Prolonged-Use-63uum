# Expo Camera Preview Freezing Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo Camera preview freezes after extended use or frequent changes to camera settings. The issue is particularly noticeable on Android devices.

## Bug Description
The Expo Camera preview may freeze or become unresponsive after a period of continuous use.  This is often exacerbated by frequent adjustments to camera settings (e.g., toggling flash mode or autofocus).  The problem is challenging to troubleshoot because it doesn't always result in a specific error message in the console.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app (requires Expo CLI and a connected Android device or emulator).
3. Use the app for some time, toggling camera settings frequently.  The preview is likely to freeze after several minutes.

## Solution
The provided solution attempts to mitigate the issue by incorporating state management and careful handling of camera lifecycle events.  This approach helps to reduce unnecessary re-renders and minimizes potential conflicts with the camera API.
